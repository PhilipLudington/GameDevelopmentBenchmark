# Implement Quadtree Spatial Partitioning

## Feature Description
Implement a quadtree data structure for efficient spatial queries and collision detection.

## Requirements
1. Create Quadtree class with insert/query
2. Automatically subdivide when capacity exceeded
3. Rebuild tree each frame
4. Support point and range queries
5. Collision detection should scale to 500+ entities

## Testing

Run the automated tests:
```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```
