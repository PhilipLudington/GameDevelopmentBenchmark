# Implement Destructible Brick Environment

## Feature Description
Create a physics-based destruction system where bricks shatter into debris.

## Requirements
1. Bricks break into physics-simulated pieces
2. Debris collides with ball and paddle
3. Debris fades and disappears over time
4. Different materials (glass, stone, metal)
5. Support 100+ debris pieces

## Testing

Run the automated tests:
```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```
