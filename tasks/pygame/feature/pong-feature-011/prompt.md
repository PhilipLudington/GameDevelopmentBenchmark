# Implement Curved Ball Trajectories

## Feature Description
Add spin mechanics where paddle movement when hitting adds curve to the ball.

## Requirements
1. Track paddle velocity at hit time
2. Apply spin based on paddle velocity
3. Ball curves in flight
4. Spin diminishes over time
5. Visual spin indicator on ball

## Testing

Run the automated tests:
```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```
