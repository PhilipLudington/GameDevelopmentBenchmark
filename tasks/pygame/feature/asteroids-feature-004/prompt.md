# Implement Particle-Based Explosion System

## Feature Description
Create an advanced particle system that simulates realistic explosions with debris, sparks, and shockwaves.

## Requirements
1. Create ParticleSystem class with object pooling
2. Different particle types: debris, sparks, smoke
3. Particles affected by gravity and drag
4. Shockwave effect that pushes nearby entities
5. Particle lifetime and fade effects
6. Performance: support 500+ active particles

## Testing

Run the automated tests:
```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```
