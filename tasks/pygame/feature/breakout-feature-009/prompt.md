# Implement Verlet Integration Rope Physics

## Feature Description
Create a power-up where the ball trails a rope that can wrap around and destroy bricks.

## Requirements
1. Implement verlet integration for rope
2. Rope connects paddle to ball
3. Rope collides with bricks
4. Rope wraps around obstacles
5. Configurable rope length and stiffness

## Testing

Run the automated tests:
```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```
